            <p>This will be the component that holds the main function of the app, the list of names with color-coding. There will be quick update, edit (we are only interested in storing the most recent contact for MVP), colored tiles, and add contact.</p>
            <p>Stretch goals will be sorting function, grouped contacts, stored contact info (to be used for cross-app functionality later), and settings page for palette swap, etc.</p>
